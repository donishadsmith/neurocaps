    """
    Merge Participant Timeseries Across Multiple Sessions or Tasks.

    Merge subject timeseries data across dictionaries, concatenating matching run IDs. Only subjects present across all
    input dictionaries are included in the merged output.

    For example, if three dictionaries are provided contain subject 1 with:

        - dict 1: run-1 (resting-state)
        - dict 2: run-1 and run-2 (Stroop)
        - dict 3: run-3 (N-back)

    Then subject 1 in the final merged dictionary will contain:

        - run-1: concatenated timeseries from dict 1 and dict 2 (resting-state + Stroop)
        - run-2: timeseries from dict 2 (Stroop)
        - run-3: timeseries from dict 3 (N-back)

    This function supports workflows for identifying similar CAPs across tasks or sessions. Specifically, using the
    merged dictionary as input for ``CAP.get_caps`` and the filtered input dictionaries, containing only subjects
    present in the merged dictionary, as inputs for ``CAP.calculate_metrics`` to compute participant-wise CAP metrics
    for each task.

    Parameters
    ----------
    subject_timeseries_list: :obj:`list[dict[str, dict[str, np.ndarray]]]` or :obj:`list[os.PathLike]`
        A list where each element consist of a dictionary mapping subject IDs to their run IDs and associated
        timeseries (TRs x ROIs) as a numpy array. Can also be a list consisting of paths to pickle files
        containing this same structure. The expected structure of each dictionary is as follows:

        ::

            subject_timeseries = {
                    "101": {
                        "run-0": np.array([...]), # Shape: TRs x ROIs
                        "run-1": np.array([...]), # Shape: TRs x ROIs
                        "run-2": np.array([...]), # Shape: TRs x ROIs
                    },
                    "102": {
                        "run-0": np.array([...]), # Shape: TRs x ROIs
                        "run-1": np.array([...]), # Shape: TRs x ROIs
                    }
                }

    return_merged_dict: :obj:`bool`, default=True
        If True, returns a single dictionary containing the merged dictionary under a key named "merged".

    return_reduced_dicts: :obj:`bool`, default=False
        If True, returns a single dictionary containing the input dictionaries filtered to only include subjects present
        in the merged dictionary. Keys are named "dict_{0}" where {0} corresponds to the dictionary's position in the
        input list.

    output_dir: :obj:`os.PathLike` or :obj:`None`, default=None
        Directory to save the merged or reduced dictionaries as pickle files. The directory will be created
        if it does not exist. For the reduced dictionaries to be saved, ``save_reduced_dicts`` must be set to True.
        If ``save_reduced_dicts`` is False and ``output_dir`` is provided, only the merged dictionary will be saved.
        Dictionaries will not be saved if None.

    filenames: :obj:`list[str]` or :obj:`None`, default=None
        A list of file names for saving dictionaries when ``output_dir`` is provided. If ``save_reduced_dicts`` is False,
        only a list with a single name should be supplied, which will be used to save the merged dictionary. If
        ``save_reduced_dicts`` is True, provide `N+1` names (where `N` is the length of subject_timeseries_list) - `N`
        names for individual reduced dictionaries followed by one name for the merged dictionary. Names are assigned by
        input position order. Full paths are handled using basename, and extensions are ignored. If None, uses default
        names - "subject_timeseries_{0}_reduced.pkl" (where {0} indicates the original input order) and
        "merged_subject_timeseries.pkl" for the merged dictionary.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.19.0  ``file_names`` to ``filenames``

    save_reduced_dicts: :obj:`bool` or None, default=False
        If True and the ``output_dir`` is provided, then the reduced dictionaries are saved as pickle files.

    Returns
    -------
    `dict[str, dict[str, dict[str, np.ndarray]]]`
