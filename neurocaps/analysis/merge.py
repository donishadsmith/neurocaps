    """Merge subject timeseries

    Merge subject timeseries dictionaries or pickle files to the first dictionary or pickle file in the list.
    Repetition times from the same subject and run are merged together. The combined dicitonary will only include subjects
    that are present in all dictionaries.

    Parameters
    ----------

    subject_timeseries_list: dict
        The list of pickle files containing the nested subject timeseries dictionary saved by the TimeSeriesExtractor class or a liist of the
        the nested subject timeseries dictionary produced by the TimeseriesExtractor class. The first level of the nested dictionary must consist of the subject
        ID as a string, the second level must consist of the the run numbers in the form of 'run-#', where # is the corresponding number of the run, and the last level 
        must consist of the timeseries associated with that run.
    return_combined_dict: bool, default=True,
        Returns the merged dictionaries if True
    return_reduced_dicts: bool, default=False
        Returns the list of dictionaries provided with only the subjects present in the combined dictionary. Returns dictionaries in the same order
        they are listed in the `subject_timeseries_list` parameter.
    output_dir: str, default=None
        Directory to save the merged dictionary to. Will be saved as a pickle file.
    file_name: str, default=None
        Name to save merged dictionary as.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If the length of `subject_timeseries_list` is less than two.

    Returns
