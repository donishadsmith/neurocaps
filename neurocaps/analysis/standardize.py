    Parameters
    ----------

    subject_timeseries_list: dict or str
        The list of pickle files containing the nested subject timeseries dictionary saved by the TimeSeriesExtractor class or a liist of the
        the nested subject timeseries dictionary produced by the TimeseriesExtractor class. The first level of the nested dictionary must consist of the subject
        ID as a string, the second level must consist of the the run numbers in the form of 'run-#', where # is the corresponding number of the run, and the last level 
        must consist of the timeseries associated with that run.
