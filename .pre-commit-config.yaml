# Note to self: commit be90954 on Mar 8, 2025 ("Add 'nilearn_data' and 'neuromaps-data' to test directory") added +927906 changes.
# Files were added to minimize fetching during GitHub Actions tests and both folders were cleaned in
# commit 8ca86d5 on Mar 12, 2025 ("Clean test data folder") to retain only the essential data needed for testing.
# Be cautious when adding data folders in the future and don't remove the below hook again to prevent large files from being included in commits.
