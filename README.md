# neurocaps
This is a Python package to perform Co-activation Patterns (CAPs) analyses, which involves using kmeans clustering to group timepoints (TR's) into brain states, on both resting-state or task data. It is compatible with data preprocessed with **fMRIPrep** and assumes your directory is BIDS-compliant and contains a derivatives folder with a pipeline folder, such as fMRIPrep, containing preprocessed BOLD data.

**Still in beta but stable.**

# Installation

This package uses pybids, which is only functional on POSIX operating system and Mac OS. To install, using your preferred terminal:

**Installation with pip:**

```bash

pip install neurocaps

```

**From source (Development version):**

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/donishadsmith/neurocaps.git
```

or

```bash

git clone https://github.com/donishadsmith/neurocaps/
cd neurocaps
pip install -e .

```

# Usage
 **This package contains two main classes - `TimeseriesExtractor`, for extracting the timeseries, and `CAP`, for performing the CAPs analysis.**

**Note**: When extracting the timeseries, **this package uses the Schaefer atlas or the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas**. The number of ROIs and networks for the Schaefer atlas can be modified with the `parcel_approach` parameter when initializing the main `TimeseriesExtractor` class. To modify it, you must use a nested dictionary, where the primary key is "Schaefer" and the sub-keys are "n_rois" and "yeo_networks". Example: `parcel_approach = {"Schaefer": {"n_rois": 100, "yeo_networks": 7}}`. Similary the version of the AAL atlas can be modified using `parcel_approach = {"AAL": {"version": "SPM12"}}`.

**Main features for `TimeseriesExtractor` includes:**

- Timeseries extraction for resting state or task data and creating a nested dictionary containing the subject ID, run number, and associated timeseries. This is used as input for the `get_caps()` method in the `CAP` class.
- Saving the nested dictionary containing timeseries as a pickle file.
- Visualizing the timeseries of a Schaefer or AAL node or network subject's run. Also includes the ability to save plots.
- Ability to use parallel processing by specifiying the number of CPU cores to use in the `n_cores` parameter in the `get_bold()` method. Testing on an HPC using a loop with `TimeseriesExtractor.get_bold()` to extract the session 1 and 2 bold timeries from 105 subjects from resting-state data (single-run containing 360 volumes) and two task datasets (three-runs containing 200 volumes each and two-runs containing 200 volumes) reduced processing time from 5 hrs 48 mins to 1 hr 26 mins (using 10 cores).

**Main features for `CAP` includes:**

- Performing the silhouette or elbow method to identify the optimal cluster size. When the optimal cluster size is identified, the optimal model is saved as an attribute.
- Visualizing the CAPs identified as an outer product or regular heatmap. For outer products, you also have the ability to use subplots to reduce the number of individual plots. You can also save the plots and use them. Please refer to the docstring for the `visualize_caps()` method in the `CAP` class to see the list of available kwargs arguments to modify plots.
- Grouping feature to perform CAPs independently on groups of subject IDs. When grouping is specified, k-means clustering, silhouette and elbow methods, as well as plotting, are done for each independent group.
- Calculating CAP metrics as described in [Liu et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.01.041)[^1] and [Yang et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118193)[^2], where *temporal fraction* is the proportion of total volumes spent in a single CAP over all volumes in a run, *persistence* is the average time spent in a single CAP before transitioning to another CAP (average consecutive/uninterrupted time), and *counts* is the frequency of each CAP observed in a run, and *transition frequency* is the number of switches between
different CAPs across the entire run.

**Additionally, the `neurocaps.analysis` submodule contains the `merge_dicts` function, which allows you to merge the subject_timeseries dictionaries (merged dictionary will be returned and can be saved as a pickle file) for overlapping subjects across tasks in order to identify similar CAPs across different tasks[^3].**

Quick code example:

term preceding the parameter will be used. in this case, all parameters 
starting with cosine will be used."""

             "rot_x", "rot_x_derivative1", "rot_y", "rot_y_derivative1", 
             "rot_z","rot_z_derivative1"]

"""If use_confounds is True but no confound_names provided, there are hardcoded 
confound names that will extract the data from the confound files outputted by fMRIPrep

white-matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). To use the acompcor components from the
